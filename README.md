# Specific Documentation Examples
Examples of different kinds of documentation that rock.

I will add specific documentation examples as I encounter them. I'll try to work with an organizational structure; it will develop holistically (I hope) more sites are added.

If you are looking for links to good documentation sites, I recommend [Beautiful Docs](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs). This repository, however, is intended for specific examples of documentation types/techniques found on those sites.
