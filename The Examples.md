## Google
* [Organize your files in Google Drive](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/2375091?hl=en&ref_topic=2375187) - Collapsing dropdown menus for the four actions you can make with folders, done with Javascript. Navigation panel above to scroll through device type. Everything stays the same but the information that drops down. These dropdowns save space and direct users right to the action they need may need help performing; users don't need to read/scan as much. Very clean.

## Stripe

* [Overview](https://stripe.com/docs) - The first thing users see is a test API key. The Home page is a complete overview. When you click links on the home page and go to another landing page, the nav bar accordions down keeping place context so you don't feel like you have wandered too far from home. Need to figure out how to make a test API like that.
